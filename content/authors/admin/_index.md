I am a third-year undergraduate student in the Department of Marine Science at Tongji University. Through a long process of self-discovery, I've found that I have a strong interest in the dynamic development of certain systems and a keen ability to unearth hidden information. Consequently, I've adopted a new online moniker, "Infoseeker". In my daily life, I enjoy making videos, particularly those involving special effects and 3D modeling. Additionally, I have a long-standing hobby that dates back to my childhood: cultivating plants, especially those from the Nymphaeaceae family (water lilies), and listening to music.
